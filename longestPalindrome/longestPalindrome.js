/**
* Implement a function that finds the longest palindrome in a given string.
* Palindrome is a string that is the same when you read it from right to left
* and from left to right.
* For example, in the string "My dad is a racecar athlete", the longest
* palindrome is "a racecar a". Count whitespaces as valid characters. Other
* palindromes in the above string include "dad", "ete", " dad " (including
* whitespace on each side of dad).

* Extra credit: The best solution for this problem runs in linear time.
* If you would like a challenge, read about Manacher's algorithm
